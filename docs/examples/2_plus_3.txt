Now I understand the project patterns. Let me ask you some questions to refine this ASCII art video idea.

**What visual style are you imagining for this ASCII art video?**

1. **Morphing Art** - Show images/shapes that transform into ASCII characters and back (Recommended) - Creates a dynamic "wow" effect showing how images become text
2. **History & Evolution** - Timeline-style showing ASCII art history from early computing to modern art
3. **Live Generation** - Simulated typing effect building ASCII art character by character
4. **Showcase Gallery** - Display multiple famous ASCII art pieces with smooth transitions

I understand you've sent "4 pleased" - this seems like it might be a partial message or shorthand. Could you clarify what you'd like me to help you with?

For example, are you:
- Rating something 4 out of 5 and expressing satisfaction?
- Referring to 4 items or tasks you're pleased about?
- Something else entirely?

Let me know what you need and I'll be happy to assist.
