 All three are buildable because:
  1. We have the tools (Claude-in-Chrome, Bash)
  2. We understand the patterns (browser automation, crontab)
  3. Similar patterns exist in claude-code-x-skills (X posting uses same browser flow)

  The work is writing the skill files with clear instructions and testing the flows.

✻ Churned for 33s

 /claude research "latest AI news" on X,
 create a 60-second video summarizing the top 3 stories,
 and upload it to YouTube

 ### 5.3 WhatsApp Integration Test
 1. Start bot: `npm start`
 2. Scan QR code
 3. Send `/claude hello` → expect response
