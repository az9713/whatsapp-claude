# Video Script Skill

Write engaging video scripts with proper structure, hooks, and timing.

## Script Structure

### 1. Hook (First 5-10 seconds)

The hook must grab attention immediately:

- **Question Hook**: "What if I told you..."
- **Statistic Hook**: "90% of people don't know..."
- **Story Hook**: "Last week, something happened..."
- **Controversy Hook**: "Everyone's been wrong about..."
- **Promise Hook**: "By the end of this video, you'll..."

### 2. Introduction (10-30 seconds)

- Briefly introduce the topic
- Establish credibility
- Preview what's coming

### 3. Main Content (Bulk of video)

Use one of these structures:

**Problem-Solution**
```
1. Present the problem
2. Explain why it matters
3. Reveal the solution
4. Show how it works
```

**List Format**
```
1. Introduce the list topic
2. Item 1 (most interesting or important)
3. Item 2
4. Item N
5. Bonus item (if applicable)
```

**Story Arc**
```
1. Setup (context)
2. Conflict (challenge)
3. Resolution (outcome)
4. Lesson (takeaway)
```

### 4. Call to Action (Last 10-30 seconds)

- Summarize key point
- Tell viewer what to do next
- Invite engagement (like, subscribe, comment)
